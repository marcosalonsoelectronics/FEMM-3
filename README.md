Files of video: FEMM #3: Analysis of an Inductor with Non-Linear Material

Available at: https://youtu.be/JPMAo8OHVAA

This video shows how to analyze in FEMM an inductor with non-linear material. The B-H curve of the material is used to model the behavior of the inductor. It is shown how the inductance decreases when the current through the inductor increases. An example of Lua script is presented to automatically obtain the inductance versus current characteristic of the inductor.
